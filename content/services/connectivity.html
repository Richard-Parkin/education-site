						<h2>Advanced Internet Connectivity for Education</h2>
						<p>Internet connectivity is a key utility for practically every modern day school, supporting an increasingly large range of requirements for education, from online resources and storage to video streaming, tablet schemes and far more. However, many schools aren't getting the level of connectivity that they require, with overly high prices and under-performing connections meaning that students don't get the access to resources that they require.</p>
						<p>For over 10 years, Exa Education has worked to give schools and academies a better option for Internet connectivity. With a full range of connectivity options, we provide schools with standout choice, speed and reliability, all at market-leading prices and backed up with award-winning customer service.</p>

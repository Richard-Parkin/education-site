							<h2>Modern-Day, School-Focused Content Filtering</h2>
							<p>With students now using the Internet more than ever, it's vital for schools to be able to monitor Internet usage and protect students from harmful content. Content filtering is a major part of achieving this protection, letting schools decide what material is accessible through their network, giving students the ability to browse safely while fully blocking dangerous material in compliance with the Prevent Duty and similar legislation.</p>
							<p>We've developed an advanced, in-house content filtering service designed to perfectly suit the requirements of schools - SurfProtect Quantum. A uniquely Cloud-based content filtering service, SurfProtect Quantum provides some fantastic features previously only available with expensive hardware-based systems, including Active Directory Integration/ per-user (or computer) filtering, while giving schools complete control over how their filtering works.</p>
							<p>Right now, SurfProtect Quantum is available in early access, as our team work to add some great new features - take a look at some of the key SurfProtect features below. You can also head over to our <a href="https://surfprotect.co.uk">SurfProtect website</a> or get in touch via the contact form below (or at <b>0345 145 1234</b>) to find out how SurfProtect can benefit your school.</p>

									<p>SurfProtect Quantum is designed to completely suit the filtering requirements of any school or academy.

									<p style="text-align:left">• <b>Intuitive Online Panel</b>: Through an easily usable online panel, teachers and administrators can plan exactly how their school's filtering policy works - what categories to block, what sites to allow, search keywords to ban, and far more.<br><br>• <b>Active Directory Integration</b>: SurfProtect Quantum allows for complete Active Directory integration, which gives administrators even more control over their filtering, letting them assign customised policies for user groups (like teachers and students), computers and individuals.<br><br>• <b>Cross-Network Protection</b>: As a Cloud-based service, SurfProtect Quantum can easily be set up on a network, giving schools effective, network-level content filtering that works across devices and computers without any additional setup.<br><br>• <b>Automatic Site Categorisation</b>: When a user attempts to access a website (including HTTPS sites), SurfProtect Quantum automatically categorises the site, updating our database in real-time, ensuring a more accurate level of filtering across every school using SurfProtect Quantum.<br><br>• <b>Powerful Analytics Suite</b>: SurfProtect Quantum includes a powerful analytics suite, which gives users the ability to see exactly how their connections are being used at any given time, seeing what searches and sites users attempt to make/ visit, what classification is applied, and who made the search/ visited the site.</p>
									<p>SurfProtect Quantum also includes a much wider range of features, with many more being worked on by our in-house team to give schools even more convenience with their content filtering - stay tuned for more information about the ongoing development!</p>

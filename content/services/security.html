								<h2>Advanced Digital Security for Schools and Academies</h2>
								<p>In the modern day, it's fundamentally important for schools to have an effective approach to cybersecurity, keeping students, their data, and your school's network as safe as possible. To support this, we offer a number of options for digital security, letting schools build comprehensive security packages.</p>
								<p>To make sure that our customers get the very best choices for their security, we work with a number of market-leading security companies, offering our customers access to their services, while also developing highly customisable security tools in-house.</p>
								<p>On this page, we've put together some information about the most popular security services that we offer. However, with many schools having different requirements, we also offer several different options – get in touch with our team at <b>0345 145 1234</b> (or fill in the contact form below) to find out more about the security options we offer schools.</p>

									<h4 class="chalk head">Student Safeguarding with NetSupport DNA</h4>
									<p>Designed to keep students safe online and teaching staff aware of how students are using the Internet, NetSupport DNA is a highly advanced monitoring, safeguarding and alerting system built specifically for schools. With NetSupport DNA, schools can take a comprehensive look at how students are using the Internet through the school's network.</p>
									<p>Along with convenient active monitoring, NetSupport DNA incorporates an advanced, highly customisable reporting suite. Unlike most other safeguarding tools, NetSupport DNA is designed to avoid false alerts by considering user behaviour in context, creating a full log of user behaviour if any worrying behaviour appears to exist. With NetSupport DNA having been designed for complete convenience, these logs can be accessed in many different ways – text, video, word cloud and more.</p>
									<p>As well as the effective safeguarding features it provides, NetSupport DNA is built as a complete asset management suite, which means that the panel gives you a comprehensive overview of how devices connected to your network are being used, letting you manage software licenses, cut costs and take more convenient control over how your network operates on a day-to-day basis.</p>

									<h4 class="chalk head">Market-Leading Firewall Protection from Fortinet</h4>
									<p>Completely protecting networks from unauthorised access, a firewall is a hugely important part of any school's cybersecurity plan. To support schools, we offer our customers some of the single most advanced firewall options on the market – the FortiGate range of firewalls from market-leading security company Fortinet.</p>
									<p>Built for completely excellent performance, FortiGate firewalls provide cross-network protection, a high level of service scalability, and real-time updates backed up by round-the-clock security research from FortiGuard Labs. With FortiGate firewalls providing a huge range of customisation options, schools can create a security policy that completely suits their requirements – our support team also provide completely free, custom setup for FortiGate firewalls, as well as all of the other hardware that we offer our customers.</p>
									<p>We offer several different models of FortiGate firewall, designed to accommodate for different levels of usage, along with several different support packages. Our expert team can advise you on the FortiGate model that best suits your school's requirements - get in touch with us directly at <b>0345 145 1234</b> or via the contact form at the bottom of this page to discuss your firewall needs!</p>

									<h4 class="chalk head">Advanced SurfProtect Quantum Content Filtering</h4>
									<p>Effectively filtering the content that students are able to view through your network is an essential part of the Prevent Duty and a great deal of additional regulation. As such, our in-house development team has created an advanced, completely customisable and low-cost content filtering solution specifically designed around the needs of schools – <a href="/services/content-filtering/">SurfProtect Quantum</a>.</p>
									<p>A completely Cloud-based content filtering solution, SurfProtect Quantum incorporates a number of features previously only available via expensive hardware-based services, including Active Directory integration for per-student/ computer filtering options and a whole lot more. Through an intuitively designed panel, administrators can decide exactly how their content filtering works, blocking certain categories of sites, allowing specific sites, choosing what students can search for - and a whole lot more.</p>
									<p>Right now, SurfProtect Quantum is in an early access state, as our team work to add in even more advanced features – stay up to date on the latest features via our <a href="https://blog.exa.net.uk/tags/surfprotect/">SurfProtect blog</a>.</p>
									<p>As an Exa Education customer, you can benefit from a major discount on SurfProtect Quantum, with the service costing just £100 a year for primary schools and £250 for secondary schools using our <a href="/services/connectivity">Internet connectivity services</a>, compared to £750/ £1000 for non-customers.</p>
